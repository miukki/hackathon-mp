# Bar Battles
An instant game you can play with a group of friends at a bar, karaoke or other social occasion. Like a hackathon :)

## Distribution
- Using location based QRs
At a bar or club, you might find a drink coaster with a QR code, or even a QR code attached to a bottle. Scan it to start playing, and then invite your friends!
- Group based sharing
Share the MP into a group, so friends at home can join the fun, and you can play along later after you go home.

## Game Experience
Pick from a few social mini-games that make hanging out more fun
- Dice games - a new take on the games people play at karaoke
- Truth or Dare - the app will provide funny content
- Team Pictionary - the app will show a picture, and the people hanging out have to guess what it is
- Movie Quotes - name the movie based on a quote

## Location based communities
Play together against other people in the Karaoke hall!
Time travel and Challenge teams that played here yesterday - but you can still send them messages through the MP

## Loyalty Program
The game mechanics create a stickiness so there is real value to the Venue to promote the app. This creates an incentive for people to come back and play at the venue.
